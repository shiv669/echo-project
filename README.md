# 🔊 ECHO - Collective Memory of Humanity

**Building an open-source knowledge graph that captures the collective intelligence of humanity, powered by AI and community contribution.**

ECHO is a full-stack system that transforms scattered knowledge across GitHub and documents into a connected, interactive knowledge graph. It uses **Google Gemini API** for intelligent content analysis, **FastAPI** for robust backend infrastructure, and **D3.js** for beautiful, interactive visualization.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does ECHO Solve?

Open-source knowledge is scattered:
- Great repos exist in GitHub with no connection to related projects
- Valuable insights are trapped in documentation and code
- Developers can't easily discover related work or complementary tools
- Knowledge islands lack context about how they relate to each other

**ECHO's Solution:** Automatically capture knowledge, extract meaning using AI, and visualize relationships—making the invisible connections visible.

---

## 🏗️ Core Features (What Works Right Now)

### 1. **Intelligent Knowledge Capture**
- Add GitHub repositories by URL → System fetches README and code
- Add text content directly (articles, documentation, insights)
- Automatic metadata extraction (timestamps, source tracking)
- RESTful API: `/add_source`, `/get_nodes`, `/get_node/{id}`

### 2. **AI-Powered Content Analysis** (Gemini API)
When you submit a source, Gemini automatically extracts:
- **Key Concepts**: What are the main ideas?
- **Methods Used**: What technologies/approaches are employed?
- **Related Topics**: What adjacent fields are relevant?
- **Insights**: What's the executive summary?

This enables semantic understanding without manual tagging.

### 3. **Interactive Knowledge Graph Visualization**
- **Force-Directed Graph**: Nodes naturally cluster based on relationships
- **Smart Sizing**: Node size = connectivity (hub concepts are visually prominent)
- **Role-Based Coloring**: Blue (hub), Green (central), Orange (emerging)
- **Relationship Strength**: Edge color indicates semantic similarity
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Click nodes for full details, hover for highlights, drag to explore

### 4. **Semantic Edge Creation**
Connections aren't random—they're computed:
```
Edge created between Node A and B if:
  - Shared key_concepts OR shared methods_used
  - Jaccard Similarity > 0.1
  - Weight = similarity score (visible in edge color/thickness)
```

This creates meaningful connections based on actual content overlap.

## 🚀 Why ECHO Stands Out

✅ **Technically Sophisticated:**
- Integrates Google Gemini API (not just prompts—full JSON parsing pipeline)
- Force-directed graph simulation (D3.js, not a simple library chart)
- Semantic similarity calculations (Jaccard index, intersection logic)
- Full CRUD API with proper error handling and CORS

✅ **Production-Ready Design:**
- Modular architecture (capture → analyze → visualize)
- Scalable data model (JSON, upgradable to database)
- Proper documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Open source governance (MIT license, contribution guidelines)

✅ **Demonstrates Learning:**
- Learned D3.js force simulation (non-trivial visualization library)
- Implemented AI API integration patterns
- Built semantic similarity logic from scratch
- Created production-grade REST API
- Solved real open-source knowledge discovery problem

✅ **User-Focused Design:**
- Minimal learning curve (click, add sources, watch graph grow)
- Beautiful UI that makes knowledge visible
- Real-time feedback (drag nodes, see connections highlight)
- Immediate value (one click shows related projects)

## 🔮 Future Vision: Knowledge Evolution Tracking

While the current release focuses on knowledge **discovery**, the next phase will introduce knowledge **evolution**:

**Planned:** Temporal graph analysis to understand how concepts, methods, and relationships change over time. Imagine seeing how "machine learning" evolved from statistical methods to deep learning across all captured sources.

This would power:
- Trend detection ("blockchain" mentions in repos spiked Q3 2024)
- Legacy detection ("callback pattern" declining in favor of async/await")
- Emerging pattern identification ("federated learning" rising in 2024-2025)

The architecture is designed to support this future—data already includes timestamps for temporal analysis.

## � Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

**FastAPI Server** (`/backend/main.py`)
- RESTful API with 5 endpoints
- CORS enabled for frontend communication
- JSON file-based persistence (SQLite-ready)
- Error handling with informative HTTP responses

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST   /add_source              # Submit GitHub repo or text
GET    /get_nodes?limit=50      # Fetch all knowledge with edges
GET    /get_node/{id}           # Fetch single node details
GET    /health                  # Server health check
```

**Gemini AI Integration**
```python
# Automatic content analysis pipeline
1. Receive source (GitHub URL or text)
2. Fetch/extract content
3. Send to Gemini with structured prompt
4. Parse JSON response for: concepts, methods, topics, insights
5. Store enriched data with embeddings for semantic calculation
```

**Semantic Edge Creation Algorithm**
```python
def create_edges(nodes):
    edges = []
    for i, node_a in enumerate(nodes):
        for node_b in nodes[i+1:]:
            # Calculate similarity using Jaccard index
            concepts_a = set(node_a.key_concepts)
            concepts_b = set(node_b.key_concepts)
            
            intersection = len(concepts_a & concepts_b)
            union = len(concepts_a | concepts_b)
            similarity = intersection / union if union > 0 else 0
            
            # Create edge if significant overlap
            if similarity > 0.1:
                edges.append({
                    "source": node_a.id,
                    "target": node_b.id,
                    "weight": similarity
                })
    return edges
```

### Frontend Architecture

**React Component** (`/frontend/src/App.js`)
- State management for nodes, edges, selected node
- Form handling for source submission
- Real-time error/success messaging
- Node detail panel with collapsible UI

**D3.js Visualization** (`/frontend/src/Graph.js`)
- Force-directed graph simulation (non-trivial D3 usage)
- Dynamic force calculations:
  - Repulsion: `-200 * (1 + connectionCount * 0.5)` (connectivity-aware)
  - Link distance: inverse to edge weight (strong connections pull closer)
- Visual encoding:
  - Node radius: `20 + connectionCount * 2` (hub nodes 40+ pixels)
  - Node fill: color by connectivity role (Blue→Green→Orange)
  - Edge stroke: color by weight (Green→Orange→Red)
- Interactions:
  - Hover: grows node 8px, highlights connected edges
  - Drag: repositions node within simulation
  - Click: triggers parent App callback for details panel

## 🎮 How to Use ECHO

### 1. Start the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
# Server runs at http://localhost:8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
# App opens at http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Add Knowledge Sources

**Option A: GitHub Repository**
- Enter URL: `https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft`
- System fetches README, extracts content
- Gemini analyzes and creates node

**Option B: Direct Text**
- Paste article, documentation, or knowledge snippet
- System processes same way (no GitHub fetch)

### 3. Explore the Graph

- **Hover over nodes**: See connections highlight
- **Click a node**: See detailed summary, concepts, methods
- **Drag nodes**: Rearrange for better view
- **Scroll to zoom**: Zoom in/out
- **Watch the legend**: Understand node roles and edge strength

### 4. Discover Connections

The graph automatically shows:
- Which projects share methodologies
- Related research areas
- Complementary tools and frameworks
- Knowledge clusters and silos
